# Teacher Student Collaboration-Fine Tuning of Large Language Models 

Model Configuration

- Model used : Bert Base and Bert Large
- Dataset: glue', 'sst2'

# TEACHER STUDENT COLLABORATIONÂ¶
In this colab, we will learn how to fine tune small LLM Model with help of Larger Language Model. Then in this concept, you are going to teach SMALL LLM Model with Larger LLM Model.

- Importing Necessary libraries
- Hugging face, pytorch
- Dataset Loading and Preprocessing
- Train , Test and Validation split from original dataset.
- Tokenize Dataset
- Prepare Training Class
- Train the Model
- Save Model for Inference
- Use Student and Teacher Model for Comparion of Results
